Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a type of neural network model used in natural language processing (NLP) and specifically in the field of word embeddings. It is designed to predict a target word based on its context, i.e., the surrounding words in a given window. CBOW is one of the two popular architectures for training word embeddings, the other being Skip-gram.
